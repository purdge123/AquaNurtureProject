# AquaNurture.Ai
Project Overview:
The project aims to create an AI application integrated with hardware components to monitor the health of fish in an aquarium. The application will utilize a camera for image capture, image recognition algorithms to detect fish health and diseases, and additional sensors for measuring  temperature. The key features include:

Fish Health Assessment:

Utilizing image recognition, the AI will assess whether the fish are healthy or ill. It will identify specific diseases afflicting the fish.
Environmental Monitoring:

Incorporating pH meters and temperature sensors to analyze water conditions. The AI will determine if these conditions are optimal for fish survival.
Chat Bot for Fish Care:

A chat bot dedicated to fish care queries will be included. Users can ask about suitable living conditions for specific fish species, inquire about compatibility between different fish types, and receive advice on maintaining a healthy aquarium environment.
Tank Management and ID Generation:

Each tank will be assigned a unique ID. The system will display the number and types of fish present in the tank. An interactive feature will enable users to add new fish to the tank. If the introduced fish is compatible (a tankmate) with existing fish, it will be highlighted in green; otherwise, it will be marked in red.
Feasibility Assessment:
Implementing this project involves multiple complex components, including AI image recognition, sensor integration, database management for tank IDs, and interactive features for user input. Each aspect demands considerable technical expertise and integration skills. The feasibility of this project would heavily depend on the available resources, access to hardware, and the team's proficiency in AI, image processing, sensor technology, and application development.

This idea presents a comprehensive approach to fish tank monitoring and care. While it's ambitious, its successful implementation could revolutionize the way aquariums are managed and provide invaluable insights into fish health and habitat maintenance.
